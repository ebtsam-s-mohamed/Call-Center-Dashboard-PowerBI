# Call-Center-Dashboard

Description
This Project is part of PwC's virtual internship on Forage. 

  The call center manager wanted to understand her department trends so I defined the following KPIs for 
a better understanding of the call center team performance:

The average speed of answer
Average customer satisfaction
Number Of Answered Calls Vs Abandoned
Number Of Solved Complains Vs Unresolved
Agents performance 
Total Number Of Calls Per Month 

Software: 
Power BI Desktop
